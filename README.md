# The DECADES Compiler: A Tutorial

This repository contains examples to run and experiment with the capabilities and different modes of the DECADES compiler, DEC++. There are two groups of examples:

1. A simple "Hello World"-like program to demonstrate the doall parallelism built into DEC++.
2. A more complex graph algorithm, "graph projections" to demonstrate doall parallelism, decoupling, and bit-serial processing capabilities.

To find out more about each, navigate to their respective directories.
