# The DECADES Compiler: A Tutorial

This repository contains examples to run and experiment with the capabilities and different modes of the DECADES compiler, DEC++. There are several examples:

1. A simple "Hello World"-like program to demonstrate the doall parallelism built into DEC++.
2. A graph algorithm written in C++, "graph projections" to demonstrate doall parallelism, decoupling, and bit-serial processing capabilities.
3. A graph algorithm written in Python, "vertex nomination" to demonstrate the capabilities of Numba and how it fits into the DEC++ framework.

To find out more about each, navigate to their respective directories.
