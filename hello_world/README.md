# Hello World

This is a simple example to illustrate the doall parallelism in DEC++. This example is vector addition, the "Hello World" equivalent for multithreaded parallel programs. All of the code is in main.cpp.

To compile the program, run the following:

        DEC++ -m db -t [num_threads] main.cpp
        
Then run:

        decades_base/decades_base
